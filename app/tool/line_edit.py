"""
LineEdit — unambiguous line-number-based file editor.

Why this exists:
    str_replace_editor fails when the target string has any whitespace difference,
    duplicate occurrence, or the model hallucinates context lines.
    apply_patch_editor requires clean hunk headers and can reject drifted patches.

    This tool avoids string matching entirely. The model reads the file with
    line numbers, identifies the exact range it wants to change, and passes
    start_line / end_line directly. The replacement is applied by list slicing —
    it CANNOT mis-match.

Workflow the model should follow:
    1. Call str_replace_editor view OR bash "cat -n <file>" to see line numbers.
    2. Identify start_line and end_line of the region to replace (inclusive, 1-indexed).
    3. Call line_edit with path, start_line, end_line, new_content.
    4. Verify the result snippet shown in the response.
